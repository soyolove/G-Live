# Local Live2D Models

Place your Live2D model folders here. Each model should be in its own folder with the following structure:

## Cubism 4 Models
```
models/
  mymodel/
    mymodel.model3.json
    mymodel.moc3
    textures/
    motions/
    expressions/
```

## Cubism 2 Models
```
models/
  mymodel/
    mymodel.model.json
    mymodel.moc
    textures/
    motions/
    expressions/
```

The viewer will automatically scan this directory and display available models in the UI.
